1) fix the white layer (as bottom) by URU'R'
2) locate 1 (only 1) "correct" piece (faces may not be correct yet) at right top corner. URU'L' UR'U'L
3) Turn white as upper layer, use URU'R' to fix the yellow face

1) Form a yellow cross with white in the centre
2) Flip the yellow pieces of the yellow cross to join the yellow centre piece, with side faces aligned
3) With yellow face at the bottom or downside, use URU'R' to fix the bottom layer, with all yellow pieces correctly positioned
4) To fix the layer, when moving upper middle piece to second layer right, URU'R', rotate the cube along U, U'L'UL; when moving upper middle piece to second layer left, U'L'UL, rotate along U', URU'R'
5) Now the bottom and middle layers should be correctly placed
6) With white in the upper layer, align the white pieces in "I" shape or "J" shape (9 o'clock'), use F URU'R' F' to form a yellow cross in the upper layer (faces may not be correct yet)
7) For the upper yellow cross, with L or L+F correct, use URU'R' U' URU'R' U'U' URU'R' to form a correctly placed yellow cross
8) Turn yellow to the bottom/downside, use URU'R' to fix the yellow faces of the corner pieces, side faces may not be correct at the moment
9) With top 2 layers correctly placed, bottom yellow face fixed (side faces of the yellow corner pieces in the bottom layer are not correct yet), use URU'R' x 3 to fix the remaining pieces
